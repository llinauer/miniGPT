MiniGPT - A small language model

This repository is an attempt on my part, to better understand transformer models and 
especially of the GPT flavour.
It is heavily inspired by Neel Nandas' "Transformers from Scratch" tutorial, which can be found 
on his website https://www.neelnanda.io/.
Any credit goes to him. I merely took his idea and botched it into something of my own.
